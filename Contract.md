# Goals
Our primary objective as a team will be to complete our project successfully through a combination of our own individual strengths and collaborative work. We hope to maintain clear communication and hold each other accountable throughout this process. Our final product will be the fruit of this and something we all should be proud of. 
# Strengths
Anthony: One of my biggest strengths is my adaptability. If necessary, I would have no issue finding alternate meeting times, taking over a certain task, or being willing to take on a different plan. This comes in handy during group work, where each member may hold a different opinion or thought process. 
Fenan: One of my strengths is a good time management. I'm also flexible and willing to step in to fill any gaps as needed.
# Rules
We believe that our work must embody each member's individual effort and ideas. 
#### Meetings
In the meantime, our current meeting times have been set on Monday from 7 pm - 8 pm, Friday from 11 am - 12 pm, and if necessary a meeting on Sunday from 9 pm - 10 pm. These meetings will be in person and if a member is not able to attend rescheduling is always an option. 
#### Communication
We spoke about being willing to hear the ideas of all in the group and being respectful of the fact we may disagree with each other at times. In the case of this, we should go with majority rule and if at a stalemate consult with Anya. 

#### Technologies
Our group has already created a shared drive where we will share all files necessary to assist each other and organize our project. All four of us are in an iMessage group chat and it serves as our primary form of communication. As stated earlier if a member is unable to attend a group session we have the option to be Facetimed or called through Zoom. 
#### Decision-Making
In regards to decisions, we will rely on a preferred unanimous consensus but go through a vote if one cannot be achieved. As stated we all hold the right to consult Anya for any conflicts that may arise. 
#### Delegation
At the start of any assignment during our Monday meeting, we will go around the table for each member to voice what they want their work for the week to be. Here we can divide, trade, and negotiate certain work in a matter that we believe is fair. 
#### Conflict Resolution
If any conflict were to arise we will approach it with respect and a clear mind. Disagreements are expected to be dealt with through reason and as a last resort through a consultation with Anya.
